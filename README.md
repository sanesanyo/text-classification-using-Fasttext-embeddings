# text-classification-using-Fasttext-embeddings
Continuing from my other repository where I used simple naive bayes with bag of words model for text classification, 
here I am going to use FastText word embeddings to see what kind of improvment do we see in classification performance. As of a matter of fact,
we do see an improvement in accuracy of around 2% depending on which model we use for classification. This improvement is rather no so signifcant
when compared to how quick and easy the simple naive bayes model was. 
Ofcourse, the data in question had a lot of numerical data in it and not so much text so I did not expect massive improvements in accuracy.
